# Bio-CSTR: Steady-State, Dynamics, and Control

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the process control and dynamic analysis of a bio-continuous stirred-tank reactor (Bio-CSTR). It includes steady-state identification, dynamic simulation, modeling, stability analysis, and feedback control design. The work was undertaken as part of a Process Control course.

## Key Features
1. **Steady-State Identification**:
   - Analysis to identify steady-state operating conditions of the Bio-CSTR. The system involves 2 output variables, cell and substrate concentration.
   
2. **Open-Loop Dynamic Simulation**:
   - Simulated the reactor dynamics under open-loop conditions.

3. **First-Order Model Approximation**:
   - Developed and validated a first-order model to represent system dynamics.

4. **Stability Analysis**:
   - Analyzed system stability under different operating conditions.

5. **Feedback Control Design**:
   - Designed and tested feedback controllers to ensure system stability and desired performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Simulation Software**: MATLAB
- **Modeling Techniques**: First-order modeling, stability criteria
- **Control Design**: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) control methods
